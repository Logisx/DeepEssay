# Grade your IELTS essay with BERT

Welcome to the IELTS Essay Grading Web Application! This web app is designed to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to have their IELTS essays assessed and receive a predicted score using a Machine Learning model.

## Model choice
**Detailed training overview with EDA and Feature engineering** can be found in the [notebook](https://github.com/Logisx/IELTS-Grading/blob/main/IELTS_Grading_with_BERT.ipynb).\
**Dataset**: [IELTS Writing Scored Essays Dataset
](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mazlumi/ielts-writing-scored-essays-dataset)

After analysing different approaches I decided to continue with 3 models:
1. **BERT fine-tuned for a regression task**
2. **BERT output concatenated with numerical features**
3. **BERT output concatenated with numerical and binary features**
  
The model structures and corresponding Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics are shown in the figures below:

Although more complex models produce better results, after testing, it was decided to use a text model for lower latency.


## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Flask
- **NLP**: TensorFlow, BERT, Hugging Face Transformers, Sklearn
- **Deployment**: Docker, Microsoft Azure
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Testing**: REST client

## Features
- **Submit Essays**: Users can submit their IELTS essays directly through the web application. The process is user-friendly and straightforward.

- **Machine Learning Essay Grading**: The heart of this application is a finely-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. This model analyzes and assesses the submitted essays, considering a variety of linguistic and structural aspects.

- **Predicted Score**: After processing the essay, the application provides users with a predicted IELTS score. This score is an estimate of how the essay might be rated in the actual IELTS exam, helping users gauge their writing proficiency.

- **Warning functionality**: The application includes a warning feature that checks the submitted text. It will display a warning if the essay is too short or if the text does not meet the minimum requirements. This ensures that users are provided with guidance on submitting valid essays.\
